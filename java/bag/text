TOKYO — Steven Gardiner of the Bahamas added an Olympic gold medal to the World Championship gold he won in 2019, pulling away from the pack with 50 meters to go and winning in 43.85 seconds.

Colombia's Anthony Jose Zambrano took silver in 44.08 seconds, and Grenada's Kirani James earned the bronze (44.19), becoming the first male to win three Olympic 400m medals.
Gardiner appeared to get out a little slow over the first 100 meters and then turned things up. The Bahamas could have the winner in both the men's and women's 400m — Shaunae Miller-Uibo, the defending gold medalist from Rio, is one of the top contenders in her race again this year.

American Michael Norman got off to a very fast start, and was in the lead with about 150 meters to go. But he was unable to hold on and finished fifth (44.31). Teammate Michael Cherry was fourth in a lifetime best 44.21.

This marks the first time in Olympic history the U.S. men didn't win a single gold medal in the short sprints (100, 200, 400) and the hurdles, per NBC Sports' Nick Zaccardi.

Norman ran 44.07 seconds at the U.S. Trials but his 44.52 in the semis here was just the fifth-best time. Norman's mother was born in Japan, and he had discussed what it meant that his first Olympics was in her homeland.

James, the pride of Grenada who won Olympic gold in 2012, has been consistent for a decade and came into the final with the fastest time in the semis. It is his third straight Olympics with a medal.

South Africa's Wayde Van Niekerk, who broke the world record in the 2016 Olympics final, did not advance to the medal race in Tokyo. Playing in a celebrity tag rugby match in 2017, Van Niekirk tore his ACL and hasn't returned to form since.

Gardiner added the Olympic gold medal to the world title in the one-lap sprint event. Colombia's Anthony Zambrano won silver with former champion Kirani James of Grenada taking bronze.

Reigning world champion Steven Gardiner added the Olympic title to his growing list of accolades winning the men’s 400m gold medal in a time of 43.85 seconds at the Tokyo National Stadium.

The 25-year-old Gardiner had to work hard for his maiden Olympic title against a quality field that included former champion Kirani James and rising U.S. star Michael Norman.

Colombia’s Jose Zambrano finished second in 44.08 for the silver medal, with James adding the full set over three Olympics bagging bronze in 44.19.

Gardiner got this nose in front and had to fight off a strong challenge from James and Zambrano in the final stretch of the race, with Norman slipping after a fast start. 

But the Gardiner banked on his experience from the last four years to produce the best run of this career, becoming the first Olympic gold medallist in an individual men's event for the Bahamas.

Gardiner has emerged as the leading one-lap sprinter over the last two years, stepping into the void left by Rio 2016 champion and world record holder Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa. Van Niekerk failed to qualify for the final in Tokyo 2020, leaving his title open for the taking. 

Gardiner auditioned for the position in 2017 when he finished second behind Van Niekerk at the world championships. He again proved his credentials as a championship racer, becoming the world champion in 2019 in Doha. 

"It feels amazing. My first Olympic Games didn't go well for me (he didn't make the final at Rio 2016) but this one here, I'm cherishing this moment. Olympic champion," Gardiner said. "When the gun went off I stumbled a bit coming out, but I recovered, I kept it moving, and with 200m to go, I started to push a little bit. And 100m to go, I gave it all I've got.

"I came across the line and saw my name on the big screen and I was in first place. I'm just happy."

The Men’s 400m finals took place on Thursday night in Tokyo, Japan, with a new set of runners trying to stake their claim as the best. In the semifinals, the world and Olympic holder Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa failed to quality for the final with a fifth place finish and time of 45.14.

With the 2016 gold medalist in Niekerk out of the picture, it meant that someone else would be the new champion of the 400m. That moniker went to Steven Gardiner of the Bahamas, who won the gold medal with a time of 43.85. The 25-year-old came into Tokyo as the world champion and easily pulled away with 150 meters to go to win the gold.

Also joining Gardiner on the podium was Anthony Jose Zambrano of Columbia, who won the silver medal with a time of 44.08. Meanwhile, Kirani James of Grenada won the bronze with a time of 44.19. The USA, however, would finish in fourth and fifth place respectively, as Michael Cherry ran a 44.21 (personal best) and Michael Norman ran a 44.31.

TOKYO – Steven Gardiner powered to gold in the Olympic 400 metres final on Thursday to maintain his four-year unbeaten streak.

The 25-year-old 2019 world champion stormed to the line in 43.85sec, with Colombia's Anthony Jose Zambrano taking silver in 44.08sec.

Grenada's Kirani James, the 2012 champion and 2016 silver medallist, took bronze in 44.19sec.

Gardiner's victory extended his dominance of the one-lap event over the past four years.

The Bahamian hasn't lost a 400m race that he has completed since taking a silver medal behind South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk at the 2017 World Championships.
Leaving aside three races where he did not finish due to injury, Gardiner has been unbeaten in 20 of 23 starts since that 2017 loss.

Gardiner's victory raises the prospect of an Olympic double for Bahamas at the 400m in Tokyo with 2016 gold medallist Shaunae Miller-Uibo running in the women's final on Friday.

Gardiner's gold medal was never really in doubt as he waited patiently before surging smoothly into the lead off the final bend.

Once in front there was only going to be one winner and Gardiner motored home in his fastest time of 2021.

But as Gardiner celebrated, there was disappointment for US hope Michael Norman, who set off quickly before fading down the home stretch and eventually finishing in fifth behind fourth-placed compatriot Michael Cherry.

TOKYO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Steven Gardiner of the Bahamas won the 400 metres on Thursday, becoming the first athlete to win Olympic gold in an individual men's event in his country's history, after a carefully balanced race shut out the Americans over a distance they once dominated.

Anthony Zambrano of Colombia took silver, becoming the first male athlete from the South American nation to win an Olympic medal in athletics.

Kirani James of Grenada grabbed bronze, his third medal in the event and his country's first of the Games, after winning gold in 2012 and silver in 2016. He is the first athlete to win three Olympic medals in the men's 400m.

Gardiner, who sat on the track holding the palms of his hands together after winning in a season's best time of 43.85 seconds, stumbled out of the blocks and trailed midway through the race.

"I recovered, I kept it moving and with 200m to go, I started to push a little bit," he said. "And (with) 100m to go, I gave it all I've got.

"I came across the line and saw my name on the big screen and I was in first place," he told reporters. "I'm cherishing this moment. Olympic champion."

James said he was happy being a part of the elite of his sport after securing bronze.

"I'm just happy to be back on the podium, happy competing against these guys, they are so good," James said. "I lost my mother in 2019, so obviously this was kind of like a goal, I wish she would have been here to see me be back."

Zambrano, who went into the race wearing gold earrings saying "400", dedicated his silver medal to his mother.

"I am very happy to win this medal and I want to dedicate this to my family, my country. But more importantly, to my mother because it is her birthday today," he said. "I want to show to the world that Colombia belongs on the athletics stage."

American Michael Cherry finished a disappointing fourth ahead of his compatriot Michael Norman to continue the country's poor run in the event.

The U.S. had won seven straight golds beginning in 1984 to 2008, with two podium sweeps during that stretch. But they have failed to win the title since, with James securing gold in 2012 and South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk winning in Rio five years ago.

On Thursday, a terrific run by Gardiner proved decisive.

After failing to make the final in 2016, he powered to victory, adding the Olympic title to the world gold he won in Doha in 2019.

He told reporters he had dealt with knee and ankle issues during the season but ran through the pain barrier to secure his country's first medal of the Games.

"When I saw that I was in front, the pain was unbearable, but I just wanted to win," Gardiner said.

From world champion to Olympic gold medallist, Steven Gardiner is the undisputed king of the men’s 400m.

Running a perfectly timed and composed race, Gardiner sprinted away from the rest of the field over the final 50 meters to win gold at the Tokyo Olympic Games on Thursday night (5).

The tall 25-year-old crossed in 43.85 to become the first man from The Bahamas to win an individual Olympic gold in any sport.

“I’m cherishing this moment," Gardiner said, before shaking his head and uttering the words he’s longed to hear attached to his name. “Olympic champion.”

Gardiner finished comfortably ahead of Anthony Zambrano, who took silver in 44.08 to become the first Colombian man to win an Olympic athletics medal. Former champion Kirani James of Grenada earned bronze in 44.19, securing his record third medal in the 400m.

In an event they used to thoroughly dominate, USA athletes were shut out of the medals completely. Teammates Michael Cherry and Michael Norman settled for fourth and fifth, respectively, in 44.21 and 44.31.

Gardiner claimed the 400m world title in Doha in 2019, two years after taking silver at the World Championships in London. He was in top form this year heading into Tokyo, winning all five of the 400m races in which he finished.

With no clear favourite going into Thursday’s final, Gardiner stamped his authority on the race with a dominant performance that left no doubt who is the world’s best.

Running in lane seven, Gardiner stayed close with Norman, James and other leaders down the backstraight, but was trailing slightly as they rounded the final turn.

With about 100 meters to go, Gardiner accelerated and was clearly in front by the 50-metre mark. With his usual upright running style and looking perfectly composed and relaxed, he pulled away with his long strides all the way to the line.
"When the gun went off, I stumbled a bit coming out," Gardiner said. “But I recovered, I kept it moving, and with 200m to go, I started to push a little bit. With 100m to go, I gave it all I've got.

“I kind of saw everybody coming up out of the corner of my eye, but I said: 'Okay, it's now or never', and I just held on. I came across the line and saw my name on the big screen and I was in first place.”

Zambrano overtook James in the final stretch to finish second, replicating the same 1-2 order from Doha and making athletics history for his country.

“I want to show the world that Colombia belongs on the athletics stage," said Zambrano, who dedicated the silver to his mother on her birthday.

As Gardiner sat on the track with his shoes and a Bahamian flag lying beside him, James came over, picked up the flag and draped it around the new champion’s shoulders.

James became the first man to win three Olympic medals in the 400m. He now has a full collection after his gold in 2012 and silver in 2016.

"I feel like Santa's come,” said James, who also dedicated the medal to his mother, who died in 2019. “It's a great achievement. I am happy to come out and represent my country and make everyone proud. I am glad that I could do that again.”

It capped a remarkable comeback by James, who was diagnosed with Graves' disease, an auto-immune condition, in 2017 and spent more than a year out of the sport.

The race dealt another setback for the United States, which was denied the gold medal in the 400m for the third Games in a row – something which has never happened before.

US runners won 400m gold in seven straight Games from 1984 to 2008 and swept the podium at five Olympics, most recently in 2008.

Then James triumphed in London in 2012 and South Africa’s Wayde van Niekerk broke the world record to win in Rio in 2016. Van Niekerk failed to qualify for the final this time.

US champion Norman, 23, long pegged as the next great American quarter-miler, will have to wait again for another chance to make his global breakthrough, while Cherry ran a personal best to miss the podium by just 0.02.

Steven Gardiner of the Bahamas added 400m Olympic gold to his 2019 World Championship success in a comfortable victory at Tokyo 2020.
The 25-year-old ran a season best time of 43.85 to finish ahead of Colombia's Anthony Jose Zambrano and London 2012 winner Kirani James.
With his upright running style, Gardiner raced clear on the final straight and even looked to ease up near the finish line to become Olympic champion.
Handed his country’s flag after winning the race, Gardiner’s celebrations were subdued as he looked shattered and took in his achievement. His victory never seriously looked in doubt, as the rest of the field around him tired.
"It feels amazing. My first Olympic Games didn't go well for me (failing to make the final at Rio 2016) but this one here, I'm cherishing this moment. Olympic champion," Gardiner said.
"When the gun went off I stumbled a bit coming out, but I recovered, I kept it moving, and with 200m to go, I started to push a little bit. And 100m to go, I gave it all I've got.
"I came across the line and saw my name on the big screen and I was in first place. I'm just happy."
James was heading for silver with 40m to go but he tightened up badly as Zambrano race passed him.

"Considering what I’ve been through the past three years, my illness, in 2019 I lost my mum so I spent a lot of time at home not training, so by the time I got to World Championships I was not in peak shape, Covid, last year and this year,” said James, who went into the race as the second fastest this year.
"It's been a rollercoaster, but I’m happy to be back on the podium, it’s a blessing. I’m happy with the bronze, even though we were aiming higher.”
